  <p>
    AID-BOT was an ambitious project aimed at creating an affordable, autonomous
    unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) capable of delivering medical supplies to
    remote or hard-to-reach areas. The project's primary goal was to design a
    solution that could help address healthcare accessibility challenges in
    rural regions with limited infrastructure.
  </p>

  <h2>Project Motivation</h2>
  <p>
    Many remote communities face significant challenges in accessing timely
    medical care and supplies. Traditional delivery methods can be impeded by:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>Poor road infrastructure</li>
    <li>Challenging terrain (mountains, forests, rivers)</li>
    <li>Seasonal weather conditions that limit ground transportation</li>
    <li>The need for rapid delivery of time-sensitive medications</li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    AID-BOT was designed as a cost-effective solution to these challenges,
    leveraging readily available components and repurposed materials to create a
    functioning medical delivery drone.

  <h2>Technical Implementation</h2>
  <p>
    The UAV was built as a fixed-wing aircraft, which offers several advantages
    over multi-rotor designs for long-distance applications:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>Superior range and endurance</li>
    <li>Better energy efficiency</li>
    <li>Higher speed for covering larger distances</li>
    <li>More stability in windy conditions</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>Flight Control System</h3>
  <p>
    At the heart of AID-BOT was an Arduino Nano functioning as the primary
    flight controller. This microcontroller managed:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>Flight stabilization and control surface management</li>
    <li>Navigation using GPS coordinates</li>
    <li>Payload release mechanism timing</li>
    <li>Data logging for flight analysis</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>Communication System</h3>
  <p>
    I built both the transmitter and receiver units using additional Arduino
    microcontrollers, which handled:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>Remote control commands for manual flight phases</li>
    <li>Telemetry data transmission back to the ground station</li>
    <li>Fail-safe protocols for emergencies</li>
    <li>Command verification for critical operations like payload release</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>Airframe Design</h3>
  <p>
    The fixed-wing craft was constructed primarily from repurposed and upcycled
    materials to keep costs low while maintaining structural integrity:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>Foam board for the main wing and fuselage structure</li>
    <li>Carbon fiber rods for reinforcement of high-stress areas</li>
    <li>
      3D printed components for specialized parts like control horns and payload
      bay
    </li>
    <li>Repurposed electronic components from older devices</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Payload Capacity</h2>
  <p>
    The aircraft was designed to carry and accurately drop a payload of
    approximately 400 grams, which is sufficient for:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>Basic medication packages and first aid supplies</li>
    <li>Small vials of temperature-sensitive vaccines</li>
    <li>Emergency medical tools and diagnostic equipment</li>
    <li>Blood samples or test kits</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Testing and Results</h2>
  <p>The AID-BOT underwent multiple iterations and testing phases:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Initial testing focused on flight stability and control</li>
    <li>
      Secondary tests evaluated payload carrying capacity and flight endurance
    </li>
    <li>
      Final testing included autonomous navigation and precision payload drops
    </li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    The project successfully demonstrated the feasibility of using low-cost
    components to build a functional medical delivery drone. While not as
    sophisticated as commercial solutions, AID-BOT proved that DIY approaches
    could deliver practical results for humanitarian applications.
