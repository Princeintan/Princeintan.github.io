  <p>
    This application was designed specifically for the IISER TVM campus
    community and received official approval from the campus council. It serves
    as a centralized social platform where students can connect, share
    information, and access campus services.
  </p>

  <h2>Key Features</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Photo sharing capabilities for campus events and activities</li>
    <li>Q&A forum for academic and campus-related questions</li>
    <li>Marketplace for students to buy and sell used items</li>
    <li>Real-time access to campus information (mess menu, events, notices)</li>
    <li>Campus services directory and information hub</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Technical Implementation</h2>
  <p>
    The application was built using Flutter and Dart, allowing for rapid
    development of a cross-platform solution with a native feel. Flutter's
    widget-based architecture enabled the creation of a responsive and intuitive
    user interface with smooth animations and transitions.
  </p>

  <p>For the backend, I implemented:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Firebase Authentication for secure user login</li>
    <li>Cloud Firestore for real-time data synchronization</li>
    <li>Firebase Storage for media content</li>
    <li>Firebase Cloud Messaging for push notifications</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Monetization Strategy</h2>
  <p>
    To help sustain the app's ongoing development and server costs, Google
    AdSense was integrated to display non-intrusive advertisements. The ad
    implementation was carefully designed to maintain user experience while
    generating modest revenue to support the app's operation.
  </p>

  <h2>Publication</h2>
  <p>
    After extensive testing and refinement, the app was successfully published
    on the Google Play Store, making it easily accessible to all campus
    community members. User feedback has been incorporated through regular
    updates to improve functionality and fix issues.
  </p>

  <h2>Impact</h2>
  <p>
    The application has become an integral part of campus life, facilitating
    better communication between students and providing easy access to important
    campus information. Usage statistics show active engagement, particularly
    around meal times (for mess menu information) and during campus events.
