    This project involved designing and building a fully functional MIDI/DJ
    controller from scratch using an Arduino Nano as the central processing
    unit. The controller was specifically designed for use with VirtualDJ
    software and has been successfully used in multiple live DJ performances.
  </p>

  <p>The controller features an extensive input array that includes:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>32 analog inputs (faders, potentiometers, and rotary encoders)</li>
    <li>16 digital inputs (buttons and switches)</li>
    <li>RGB LED feedback indicators for various controller states</li>
  </ul>

    id="technical-implementation"

  <p>
    To handle the large number of inputs with the limited I/O pins available on
    the Arduino Nano, I implemented:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>Three 16-channel multiplexers (CD74HC4067) for input expansion</li>
    <li>Custom PCB design for reliable connections between components</li>
    <li>Efficient interrupt-based polling system for responsive controls</li>
    <li>
      Virtual serial port to MIDI converter for communication with the host
      computer
    </li>
  </ul>

  <SectionHeading title="Case Design" id="case-design" icon="cube" />
  <p>
    The controller's case was designed using 3D modeling software and 3D printed
    in multiple parts for easy assembly and maintenance. The case design
    features:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>Integrated cable management for a clean setup</li>
    <li>Modular design for easy access to internal components</li>
    <li>Customizable faceplate for different control layouts</li>
  </ul>

  <SectionHeading
    title="Performance testing"
    id="performance-testing"
    icon="tachometer-alt"

  <p>
    The controller underwent extensive performance testing to ensure reliable
    operation in live DJ environments. The testing included:dusty environments,
    a long period of continuous use, and exposure to high humidity levels.
    Disassembly and reassembly for maintenance and repairs were also tested.
  </p>

  <p>
    The controller has been used in multiple live DJ performances and has
    received positive feedback from professional DJs. The customizable layout
    and responsive controls have made it a valuable tool for live mixing and
    performance.
