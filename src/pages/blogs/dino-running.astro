  <p>
    Dino Running is an engaging endless runner game inspired by the popular
    Chrome browser offline dinosaur game. Players control a dinosaur character
    as it jumps over cacti and avoids obstacles, with the difficulty gradually
    increasing as the game progresses.

  <h2>Game Development</h2>
  <p>
    I developed this game using Dart and Flutter, which allowed for smooth
    animations and responsive controls. Flutter's custom painting capabilities
    were particularly useful for rendering game elements and creating a fluid
    gaming experience.

    align="wide"

  <h2>Technical Features</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Custom physics engine for jump mechanics and collision detection</li>
    <li>Progressive difficulty scaling as gameplay continues</li>
    <li>High score tracking and persistence</li>
    <li>Responsive controls optimized for mobile play</li>
    <li>Sound effects and minimal visual design for an engaging experience</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Monetization</h2>
  <p>
    To support ongoing development and updates, I integrated Google AdSense for
    in-game advertisements. These ads are implemented in a non-intrusive manner,
    typically appearing between game sessions rather than during active gameplay
    to maintain a positive user experience.
  </p>

  <h2>Publication</h2>
  <p>
    The game was successfully published on the Google Play Store in September
    2023 and has received positive reviews from users. Regular updates have been
    released to add features and fix bugs based on user feedback.
  </p>

  <h2>Future Enhancements</h2>
  <p>I'm currently working on additional features for the game, including:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>New character skins and customization options</li>
    <li>Different game environments and themes</li>
    <li>Power-ups and special abilities</li>
    <li>Global leaderboards using Google Play Games services</li>
  </ul>
